# Home Assistant (Hassio) Add-Ons
This repository contains my personal add-ons for Home Assistant. Feel free to install and use the add-ons if you find them useful. Most are just wrappers for existing DockerHub images.

## Installation

Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Supervisor** -> **Add-on Store** and add this URL as an additional repository:
